**Exploring deeper implementation details**

The user provided a list of journals along with the source for Impact Factors and their tech preferences (Flask, free/low cost solutions with good documentation). They want to go deeper into the specifics of implementation, like parsing the RSS feeds for these journals. I need to identify and fetch the correct RSS feed URLs for Nature and its specialized journals. To do this, I might have to search for the appropriate RSS links for each journal. It's a next important step!

**Designing the technical approach**

I'm considering doing a web search to locate the RSS feed URLs for the journals. The alternative is asking the user to find them. For the Impact Factor metrics, we might scrape the metrics page using BeautifulSoup. The backend will likely use Flask and SQLite, both low-cost options. For deployment, I'm thinking of GitHub Actions or a free host like PythonAnywhere. I'll also need a basic Flask app skeleton with endpoints and a deeper plan, including code snippets for functionality like fetching or digesting data.

**Proposing backend setup**

To set up the backend, we could use PythonAnywhere for Flask hosting and schedule daily tasks with their cron. For static content, GitHub Pages is perfect. I'll show how to set up GitHub Actions, complete with YAML, to run a daily cron job. For scraping, I'll guide you through using requests and BeautifulSoup, along with some caching. We can use PythonAnywhere's free tier for small tasks and simple Flask-looking APIs, combined with other free tools like SendGrid for emails and Render for hosting.

**Proposing hosting and setup**

The user wants a dynamic system for voting feedback, but not a backend. I'm thinking GitHub Issues could work, but it's too hacky. Instead, I'm suggesting hosting the feedback API on PythonAnywhere's free plan. For static content, GitHub Pages could handle that. They're familiar with Flask, so PythonAnywhere is a good match. Alternatively, Render or Railway are other options. I'll also propose SQLite for the database, as it's free and easy to set up. I'll dive into more details on the setup and documentation.

**Proposing dynamic solution**

Since static sites can't record votes, I'm suggesting we host the feedback API using Cloudflare Workers, storing vote counts in Workers KV. However, considering the user's expertise with Flask, PythonAnywhere seems like a better choice. I propose hosting the API on PythonAnywhere's free plan, which includes 500MB. We can schedule tasks using PythonAnywhere's scheduler. This would work particularly well for Python, which the user is comfortable with. We can keep everything flexible and dynamic this way!

**Digging deeper: Journal and RSS setup**

It looks like the user is looking for a more detailed plan. The next step is to identify the relevant journals and their RSS feed URLs. I'll begin by searching for feeds, like the one for "Nature Reviews Drug Discovery", and compile this information for the user. This will help create a broader scope for incorporating selected journals, gathering metrics, and creating documentation for the Flask setup with free or low-cost hosting, while keeping everything organized. I'll dive into this search now.

**Proposing hosting and database solutions**

For hosting, I suggest using GitHub Pages to manage the static site. PythonAnywhere can help with committing via GitHub API, but its free tier supports internet access, so that's fine. Alternatively, Render or Railway can host Flask with task scheduling via cron, offering free options too. As for databases, SQLite is easier and free, but PostgreSQL also works on Render's free plan. I'll propose PythonAnywhere and Render, and link their docs for the user to explore more.

**Gathering RSS feed URLs**

I've found the actual RSS feed links for several journals. For "Nature Reviews Drug Discovery," the current issue feed is [https://www.nature.com/nrd/current_issue/rss](https://www.nature.com/nrd/current_issue/rss) and the AOP feed is [https://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/vaop/ncurrent/rss.rdf](https://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/vaop/ncurrent/rss.rdf). Similarly, "Nature Reviews Cancer" has these URLs: current issue [https://www.nature.com/nrc/current_issue/rss](https://www.nature.com/nrc/current_issue/rss) and AOP [https://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/vaop/ncurrent/rss.rdf](https://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/vaop/ncurrent/rss.rdf). For "Nature Biomedical Engineering," the RSS feed is [https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/rss](https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/rss).

**Finding Biomedical Engineering RSS Feed**

I've come across some search results showing possible RSS feeds for "Nature Biomedical Engineering," but I'm not entirely sure which one is the right fit. I found a generic feed [https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng.rss](https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng.rss), and another possibility could be [https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/current-issue/rss](https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/current-issue/rss). However, a broader feed like [https://www.nature.com/subjects/biomedical-engineering/rss](https://www.nature.com/subjects/biomedical-engineering/rss) covers multiple subjects, not just the specific journal. I'll suggest trying the first two for now!

**Verifying RSS feed link**

I need to confirm the correct RSS feed URL for "Nature Biomedical Engineering." The page provides an RSS feed link: [https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/current-issue/rss](https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/current-issue/rss), which seems like the right one. I also considered potential variations in the URL format, like using underscores. Other journals like NBT and NG also have similar RSS links for their current issues. So, I'll stick with this verified link for "Nature Biomedical Engineering."

**Confirming RSS feed URLs**

For "Nature Biomedical Engineering," the correct feed URL seems to be [https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/current-issue/rss](https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/current-issue/rss). Additionally, the AOP feed is likely [https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/rss.rdf](https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/rss.rdf). Other journals use similar formats, like NBT and NG, so this pattern fits. It appears reliable for the biomedical engineering journal you're after.

**Routing and GitHub Setup**

For the voting system, I'll use SQLAlchemy ORM to handle votes with fields like DOI, vote type, and timestamp. The routing will allow feedback through the `/feedback` endpoint, handling valid "up" or "down" votes. For stats, I'll aggregate the votes by paper DOI and return insights as JSON. In `archiver.py`, I'll use PyGitHub to commit digests to a repo or update the file. The GitHub Actions workflow ensures a daily digest run with API keys securely set. Lastly, the Flask app will be hosted on PythonAnywhere.

**Choosing Hosting Configuration**

It looks like the feedback API and the email pipeline need to be hosted separately. Since GitHub Actions will handle the pipeline, I'll need to host the API continuously on PythonAnywhere. However, free accounts on PythonAnywhere can only schedule one task, which limits flexibility. I could explore hosting both the pipeline and API on PythonAnywhere, though scheduling at 7am PST might be tricky. Alternatively, I could separate the tasks, using GitHub for archiving and PythonAnywhere for the rest.

**Proposing Hosting Setup**

I'm suggesting hosting the entire Flask app on PythonAnywhere, including the feedback API and the archiver command, which can be run as scheduled tasks. The `run_digest.py` script can be executed daily at 7:00 AM PST, where it performs fetch, summary, email, and commit operations. Free accounts on PythonAnywhere do restrict CPU and can "sleep," but they allow for one scheduled task, which is perfect for this. Alternatively, Render's free tier could be an option, but it adds complexity. Let's stick with PythonAnywhere for now.

**Considering Hosting Options**

I'm looking at different free or low-cost solutions for hosting. My primary pick is PythonAnywhere, as its free tier offers a single scheduled task, 500MB of disk space, and decent documentation. Alternative options include Render, Railway, and GitHub Actions (for workflows but not API hosting). Azure Functions and AWS Lambda are also available but add complexity for Flask. For now, I'll prioritize PythonAnywhere and Render and get organized with the necessary feed URLs for integration.

    if doi and vote in ("up", "down"):
        db.session.add(Vote(paper_doi=doi, vote=vote))
        db.session.commit()
        return redirect(request.args.get("next") or f"https://doi.org/{doi}")
    return "Invalid", 400

@bp.route("/stats")
def stats():
    data = db.session.query(Vote.paper_doi, Vote.vote, func.count()).group_by(Vote.paper_doi,Vote.vote).all()
    return jsonify({doi: {"up": u, "down": d} for doi, vote, count in data})
```

*Uses SQLite (zero cost) via SQLAlchemy.*

**Creating design spec**

The user asked for a detailed project plan and design spec, including an Impact Factor-based ranking system, thumbs up/down voting via email, and a GitHub Pages archive. I'll need to break it down into components like ingestion, ranking, summarization, email, feedback handling, and archiving. I'll outline the architecture, tech stack, storage schema, endpoints, and CI/CD setup. Additionally, a timeline and phases for the project will be helpful. I'll use markdown formatting and ensure the details are clear, focusing on the Impact Factor system.

**Finalizing project plan proposal**

I'll propose storing the Impact Factor mapping and implementing feedback integration on GitHub Pages. The archive will be static HTML with summaries and digest links, built via CI. Feedback will be tracked in a JSON file, updated by a commit pipeline, and displayed dynamically using JavaScript fetching data from an external API. I'll use SendGrid for email, GitHub actions for CI, and host on Heroku or AWS. The plan will include 5 phases and detail tasks, components, tech stack, and storage options like SQLite or PostgreSQL.

Thought for 7 seconds

Here's a detailed design spec and project plan incorporating:

* **Impact‚ÄëFactor only** ranking
* **Thumbs‚ÄØup/down** feedback in email
* **GitHub‚ÄØPages** archive

---

## 1. System Overview

You'll build a daily pipeline that:

1. **Fetches** new articles from your chosen Nature journals' RSS feeds.
2. **Annotates** each with its Journal Impact Factor (IF).
3. **Selects & Ranks** the top‚ÄØN by IF.
4. **Summarizes** via an LLM (batch‚Äëprompt).
5. **Emails** a styled digest with üëç/üëé links.
6. **Records** clicks on a backend service.
7. **Archives** each day's digest on GitHub‚ÄØPages.
8. **Displays** vote tallies dynamically on your static site.

## 4. Core Modules & APIs

### 4.1 RSS Fetcher

* **Input:** list of `{journal, rss_url}`
* **Output:** new `Paper` records
* **Tech:** Python + `feedparser`

### 4.2 IF Annotator & Ranking

* **Load** static JSON: `{ journal: impact_factor }`
* **Filter/Sort:** pick top‚ÄØN by `impact_factor`
* **Persist** `Digest` for today

### 4.3 Summarization

* **Batch Prompt:**

  ```
  "Here are 5 abstracts. For each, write a 2‚Äësentence summary focusing on novelty.  
   Then rank them by interest and list the top 3."
  [Abstract 1]‚Ä¶[Abstract 5]
  ```
* **API:** OpenAI (or self‚Äëhosted)
* **Output:** list of summaries + "most interesting" picks

### 4.4 Email Builder

* **Template (Jinja2):**

  * Header: date, "Nature Digest"
  * Ranked list:

    1. **Title** (IF = X.Y)

       * ‚ñ∫ \[link]
       * *2‚Äësentence summary*
       * üëç `<a href="https://api.yourdomain.com/feedback?doi=‚Ä¶&vote=up">`
       * üëé `<a href="https://api.yourdomain.com/feedback?doi=‚Ä¶&vote=down">`
  * Footer: link to archive on GitHub‚ÄØPages
* **Mailer:** SendGrid SMTP

### 4.5 Feedback API

* **Route:** `GET /feedback?doi=&vote=`

  * Validate params, record `Vote` in DB, then **redirect** to the paper's DOI URL or a "Thanks" page.
* **Route:** `GET /stats`

  * Return JSON:

    ```json
    { "10.1038/xyz": { "up": 12, "down": 3 }, ‚Ä¶ }
    ```

### 4.6 Archiver

* **Generate** for `YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `.html` under `/digests/` folder, using the same content as the email plus a `<div id="votes">`.
* **Commit & Push** via GitHub API or CLI using a bot token.

### 4.7 GitHub‚ÄØPages Site

* **Index Page:** lists links to each `/digests/YYYY-MM-DD.html`.
* **Digest Pages:**

  * Static content: title, summaries
  * Client‚Äëside JS:

    ```js
    fetch("https://api.yourdomain.com/stats")
      .then(r=>r.json())
      .then(stats=>{
        // find this digest's DOIs and inject vote counts next to üëç/üëé
      });
    ```
* **Deployment:** automatically rebuilt on each push to `main`

### Next Steps

1. **Lock down** your list of Nature journals and their IF values.
2. **Build** the RSS‚ÄØ‚Üí‚ÄØranking prototype and verify it selects the correct top‚ÄØN.
3. **Draft** your email template and test a single local email (with dummy feedback links).

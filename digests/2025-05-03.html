    <div class='paper-summary'>
      <h3>Image-guided surgical approach using dye CJ215 for cancer detection and removal</h3>
      <p>This study addresses the challenge of accurately detecting and removing cancerous tissues during surgery. By employing the commercially available dye CJ215, the authors developed an image-guided technique that enhances real-time visualization of tumors, enabling more precise excision and improved preclinical monitoring of cancer progression in deep tissues, which may significantly improve surgical outcomes.</p>

    <div class='paper-summary'>
      <h3>Mechanistic insights and applications of targeted protein degradation in cancer therapy</h3>
      <p>Hinterndorfer et al. review the emerging pharmacological approach of targeted protein degradation (TPD) for cancer treatment. They elucidate the underlying mechanisms, highlight the benefits of established degraders, and discuss novel classes of compounds, positioning TPD as a promising modality with potential to overcome limitations of traditional therapies.</p>

      <h3>Tumour suppressive role of androgen receptor in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer</h3>
      <p>Dimple Notani explores a study revealing that the androgen receptor functions as a tumor suppressor in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. This finding challenges previous paradigms and suggests potential therapeutic strategies targeting androgen receptor pathways in this breast cancer subtype.</p>

    <div class='paper-summary'>
      <h3>MHC Hammer: computational tool for measuring HLA disruption using sequencing data</h3>
      <p>Clare Puttick introduces MHC Hammer, a novel computational tool designed to assess human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disruption by integrating whole-exome and RNA sequencing data. This tool enhances the ability to analyze immune-related genetic alterations, facilitating research into immune evasion and cancer immunology.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='paper-summary'>
      <h3>Genetic analyses refine models of metastasis evolution in cancer</h3>
      <p>Kamila Naxerova discusses how comparative genetic studies of primary tumors and matched metastases can discriminate between competing models of metastasis evolution. The perspective emphasizes the need for quantitative frameworks to determine whether metastases arise from selective primary tumor lineages, advancing our understanding of metastatic biology and informing targeted interventions.</p>
